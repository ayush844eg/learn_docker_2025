## 🔹 What is Docker Layer Caching?

* Every instruction in a `Dockerfile` (`FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.) creates a **new image layer**.
* Docker caches these layers locally.
* If Docker sees that nothing has changed in a step, it reuses the cached layer instead of rebuilding it.

👉 Example:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

When you run `docker build .`, Docker checks step by step:

1. **FROM node:18**
   → Cached if the base image hasn’t changed.

2. **WORKDIR /app**
   → Cached (always deterministic).

3. **COPY package.json package-lock.json ./**
   → Cached if these two files are unchanged.

4. **RUN npm install**
   → Cached only if the previous step didn’t change (dependencies unchanged).

5. **COPY . .**
   → Invalidates cache if **any source code file changes**.

6. **CMD ...**
   → Always cached unless modified.

## 🔹 Why is Order Important?

Layer caching works **top-to-bottom**. If one step changes, **all following steps are invalidated**.

👉 Example:

```dockerfile
# ❌ Inefficient
COPY . .
RUN npm install
```

If you change just **one line of code**, Docker will:

* Re-run `COPY . .` (whole app copied again)
* Re-run `npm install` (even if dependencies didn’t change)

That wastes time ⏳.

👉 Better:

```dockerfile
# ✅ Efficient
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```

Now:

* Dependency installation is cached unless `package.json` changes.
* Code changes only re-trigger the `COPY . .` step, not `npm install`.

## 🔹 Example with Python

I’ll show you a bad vs good case.

### ❌ Bad Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

* If you change **one line in app.py**, the whole `COPY . .` step invalidates.
* That forces `pip install` to run again (slow).

---

### ✅ Good Dockerfile (Efficient Caching)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only requirements first
COPY requirements.txt ./

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then copy rest of the source code
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Now:

* `pip install` is cached unless `requirements.txt` changes.
* Only code (`COPY . .`) needs to be rebuilt when you change `.py` files.

---

## 🔹 Advanced Example: Multi-Stage Build + Caching

Sometimes you need **build dependencies** but don’t want them in the final image.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci  # more reproducible than npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Here:

* Dependencies install in **builder stage**, cached efficiently.
* Final image is **slimmer** because it only has production files.

---

## 🔹 Best Practices for Efficient Layer Caching

1. **Order COPYs smartly**

   * Copy dependency files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`) first.
   * Install deps.
   * Copy app code later.

2. **Use `.dockerignore`**

   * Exclude unnecessary files (`node_modules`, `.git`, logs).
   * Prevent cache invalidation from irrelevant changes.

3. **Group related RUN commands**

   ```dockerfile
   # Instead of multiple layers
   RUN apt-get update
   RUN apt-get install -y curl
   RUN apt-get clean

   # ✅ Combine
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   ```

   Fewer layers → smaller image.

4. **Leverage build cache mounts (Docker 18.09+)**
   Example for caching `pip` downloads:

   ```dockerfile
   RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This way, pip cache persists across builds.

---

✅ **In short:**

* Layers are cached step by step.
* The earlier a layer is, the more things depend on it.
* Always structure Dockerfiles so that **slow operations (like dependency installs) come before fast-changing code**.
* Use `.dockerignore` and multi-stage builds for efficiency.
