# üß† Overview: What is Docker Networking?

Docker networking is the system by which **containers** communicate:

* With each other
* With the **host**
* With the **outside world**

It's made possible through **network drivers**, **virtual interfaces**, **bridges**, **namespaces**, and **iptables rules** managed by Docker.

---

## üîå 1. What Are Docker Network Drivers?

A **network driver** is a plugin that implements a specific **networking strategy** or configuration in Docker. It determines how containers connect to each other and the outside world.

Docker includes **built-in drivers** (out-of-the-box), but also supports **custom drivers** via plugins (for example, Calico, Weave, etc.).

### üõ† Built-in Network Drivers:

| Driver      | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge**  | Default driver for standalone containers; creates a private internal network |
| **host**    | Removes isolation between container and host network                         |
| **overlay** | Creates networks spanning multiple Docker hosts (Swarm only)                 |
| **macvlan** | Assigns MAC addresses to containers, making them appear as physical hosts    |
| **none**    | Disables all networking for a container                                      |

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. The Default Docker Network Setup

When Docker is installed and started:

* Docker creates a **default bridge network** called `bridge`
* Also creates the **`docker0`** bridge interface on the host
* This is visible by running:

  ```bash
  docker network ls
  ```

### Default Networks Docker Creates:

```bash
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
a1b2c3d4e5f6   bridge    bridge    local
b2c3d4e5f6g7   host      host      local
c3d4e5f6g7h8   none      null      local
```

### Default Bridge (`bridge`)

* This is used when no `--network` is specified.
* It:

  * Creates a **NAT**-based network using **iptables**
  * Assigns IP addresses from a private subnet (e.g., `172.17.0.0/16`)
  * Connects containers to the `docker0` bridge interface

---

## üîó 3. How Docker Networking Works Internally

Docker relies on core Linux features:

### üß± Linux Network Namespaces

Each container runs in its own **network namespace**, which isolates:

* IP addresses
* Routing tables
* Interfaces
* DNS settings

### üß∂ Virtual Ethernet Interfaces (veth pairs)

* A **veth pair** is like a virtual cable connecting the container to the host.
* One end is inside the container (e.g., `eth0`)
* One end is on the host and connected to the bridge (`vethXYZ` ‚Üí `docker0`)

### üîß Example:

For a container connected to the bridge network:

* Host:

  * Interface: `docker0`
  * IP: `172.17.0.1`
* Container:

  * Interface: `eth0`
  * IP: `172.17.0.2`
* Communication:

  * Packets from container go through `veth`, hit `docker0`, routed/NATed to the outside world.

---

## üîê 4. Docker's Use of iptables

Docker dynamically configures **iptables** rules to:

* Allow/deny traffic
* Handle **NAT (masquerading)** for internet access
* Perform **port forwarding** (for `-p` or `--publish`)

Example:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Creates a rule like:

```
iptables -t nat -A DOCKER -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.17.0.2:80
```

---

## üåâ 5. User-Defined Bridge Networks vs Default Bridge

### Default `bridge`:

* Limited DNS-based name resolution
* No automatic service discovery

### User-Defined `bridge`:

```bash
docker network create my_bridge
```

* Allows **container name resolution via internal DNS**
* Better isolation and easier management

```bash
docker run -d --network my_bridge --name web nginx
docker run -d --network my_bridge --name app alpine
```

Now `app` can ping `web` by name.

---

## üåê 6. Host Network Driver

* Shares host's IP and ports
* No network namespace isolation

```bash
docker run --network host nginx
```

### Pros:

* Zero overhead
* Ideal for performance-sensitive applications

### Cons:

* No container isolation
* Can conflict with host services

---

## üåç 7. Overlay Networks (for Docker Swarm)

Overlay networks allow containers on **different Docker hosts** to communicate as if on the same network.

* Used with **Swarm mode**
* Built using **VXLAN** tunnels
* Traffic is encrypted by default (if set)

```bash
docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --attachable \
  my_overlay
```

This enables scalable, distributed microservices.

---

## üì∂ 8. Macvlan Networks

Lets containers appear as **physical devices on the LAN**.

### Setup:

* Assign MAC & IP from your actual network
* Can talk to other devices on your LAN (e.g., routers, printers)

```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 macvlan_net
```

### Use case:

* Containers that need to be on the same level as physical servers
* Often used in **legacy systems** or when container IPs need to be reachable externally

---

## üö´ 9. None Network

* Completely disables networking
* Useful for security, testing, or when you manually configure networking

```bash
docker run --network none alpine
```

---

## üß† 10. DNS and Service Discovery

* Docker has a built-in **DNS server** that works inside user-defined networks
* Containers can use service/container **names** to reach each other (like `redis`, `db`, etc.)
* Works only in **user-defined networks** (not the default `bridge`)

---

## üì¶ 11. Docker Compose and Networking

Docker Compose creates a **default network** for your services, unless you specify otherwise.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
  app:
    image: alpine
    command: ping web
```

* Compose will create a network: `projectname_default`
* `web` and `app` can talk using names: `web`, `app`

You can also define custom networks:

```yaml
networks:
  mynet:
services:
  web:
    networks:
      - mynet
```
